            You have high myopia(shortsightedness) combined with high astigmatism . Nearsighted
            (shortsighted) means that the near vision is better than the far vision. Astigmatism
            means that images from distant objects, entering the eye, are not focused at the
            same focal point. Most commonly this is because the cornea is more curved in one
            direction than in the other, similar to the curvature of a football or teaspoon.
            In this prescription, the focal points are both focused in front of the retina,
            instead of on the retina (where the image would be destined to focus). The astigmatism
            is at an axis of 1 degrees.<br />
            There is additional power, added for near vision, of 0.25 diopters.This is most
            commonly seen as a treatment for the difficulty with near vision usually encountered,
            for the first time, between the ages of forty to fifty.</p>
